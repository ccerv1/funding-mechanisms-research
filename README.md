# Funding Mechanisms Research

A working catalog of existing, new, and experimental mechanisms for funding public goods.

There are over 50 funding mechanisms included here.

- Legacy: funding mechanisms that have been in widespread use for at least 30 years (think: taxes, grants, tipping, and endowments)

- New: funding mechanisms that have been in (relatively) widespread use for less 30 years (think: crowdfunding, hackathons, social impact bonds, proof of work)


- Experimental: funding mechanisms that are still in the experimental stages (think: Harberger Taxes, NFTs, quadratic funding, and lots of others you may not have heard about)
