# Ranking Choice Voting

`New`

### Description

Ranked choice voting (RCV) is a voting system in which voters rank their preferred candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the votes for that candidate are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on the second preference indicated on the ballots. This process is repeated until one candidate receives a majority of votes.

RCV is different than traditional voting, also known as first-past-the-post voting, because it allows voters to express more than one preference and ensures that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters.
