# Tipping

`Legacy`

### Description

Tipping is a practice in which a customer gives a gratuity, or extra payment, to a service worker in addition to the standard cost of a service or product. Tipping is commonly used in the service industry, such as in restaurants, bars, and hotels, as a way for customers to show appreciation for good service. The amount of the tip is typically left to the discretion of the customer, although some establishments may have suggested tipping guidelines.

Tip jars are also a way for people to fund public goods by leaving a small amount of money in a designated container. These extra payments can be used to offset the operating costs of public goods, such as providing additional resources or funding for maintenance and upkeep. 

Finally, people may give tips to public servants who are working in their community during the holiday period to supplement their wages from the government.

### Examples

- Coffee shops: Many coffee shops, especially smaller, independent ones, use tip jars as a way for customers to leave a small amount of money for the staff. This is especially common when the standard wage for baristas and other staff members is relatively low.
- Public parks: Many public parks rely on donations and other sources of funding to maintain their facilities and keep them in good condition. Some parks may use tip jars as a way for visitors to leave a small amount of money as a contribution towards the park's operating costs. These contributions can be used to fund things like park maintenance, landscaping, and other improvements.
