# Tolls and Entrance Fees

`Legacy`

### Description

Tolls are fees that are collected for the use of a particular road, bridge, or other transportation infrastructure. In many cases, these facilities are owned and operated by government agencies or public-private partnerships, and tolls provide a way to cover the costs of maintaining and improving these facilities. Tolls have a long history, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient Rome, where tolls were collected for the use of roads and bridges.

Park entrance fees are charges that are collected for the use of a particular public park or recreational area. These fees are an important source of income for the agencies that manage and maintain these areas, and they are used to fund a variety of expenses, including park staff salaries, infrastructure maintenance, and conservation efforts. Park entrance fees are often used in conjunction with other sources of funding, such as taxpayer dollars and charitable donations.

### Examples

- Two examples of infrastructure that rely on tolls for income include the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia.
- Examples of public parks that charge entrance fees include Yellowstone National Park and Yosemite National Park. Both of these parks are managed by the National Park Service, which is a federal agency that operates a system of national parks and other protected areas in the United States.
