# Buy One, Give One

`New`

### Description

"Buy One, Give One" (B1G1) is a business model in which a company donates a product or service to a person in need for every product or service purchased by a customer. This approach aims to create a positive social or environmental impact through the sale of consumer products. 

### Examples

- TOMS Shoes was one of the first B1G1 companies, donating one pair of shoes for every purchase.
- For every pair of [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/buy-a-pair-give-a-pair) glasses purchased, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need.
