# Quadratic Funding

`Experimental`

### Description

Quadratic Funding (QF) is an algorithmic funding mechanism that optimizes the distribution of a pool of matching funds to an array of proposed projects. QF does this by coupling the matching pool with a crowdfunding platform wherein participants can propose projects and put personal resources towards particular projects. The input of proposals and resources as votes then guides the matching pool's distribution to be maximally democratic based on the number of contributions as opposed to the total dollar amount raised by a particular project.

The mathematically optimized democratic outcome is achieved by taking the square root of each contribution to a project, then adding these values together and taking the square of the result. That number then denotes the proportion of the matching pool is added to the project as a subsidy on top of the contributions from crowdfunding.

### Examples

- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants) is a platform for discovering and funding public goods with quadratic funding.

- [clr.fund](https://clr.fund) is a protocol for efficiently allocating funds to public goods that benefit the Ethereum Network according to the prefences of the Ethereum Community.
