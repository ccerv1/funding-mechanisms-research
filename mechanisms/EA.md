# Effective Altruism

`New`

### Description

Effective altruism is a movement that uses reason and evidence to figure out how to do the most good. It is based on the idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the most good that you can.

The effective altruism movement is made up of people from many different walks of life who share a common interest in figuring out how to use their resources to do the most good. They are scientists, students, professionals, and retirees who use their skills to research, advocate, and donate to the most effective causes.

The effective altruism movement has gained momentum in recent years, with the founding of several organizations, the launch of effective altruism conferences, and the growth of an online community of effective altruists.
