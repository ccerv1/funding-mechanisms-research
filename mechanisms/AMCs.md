# Advance Market Commitments

`New`

### Description

Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) are innovative financing mechanisms designed to incentivize the development and production of essential products or services in various sectors. By guaranteeing a market and price for these products or services, AMCs provide a financial incentive for private-sector entities to invest in research, development, and implementation efforts, especially in cases where traditional market forces may not provide sufficient incentives. The goal of AMCs is to ensure the rapid development, production, and distribution of vital products or services, addressing both global and local challenges in various industries, such as healthcare, renewable energy, and infrastructure.

### Examples

- Pneumococcal AMC: Launched in 2009, the pneumococcal AMC was the first Advance Market Commitment implemented to accelerate the development and distribution of pneumococcal vaccines for low-income countries. The initiative was supported by several governments and organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. As a result of this AMC, millions of children in low-income countries have gained access to life-saving vaccines.
- Frontier Climate AMC: Frontier is an AMC focused on accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies by guaranteeing future demand for them. It aims to send a strong demand signal to researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors in the carbon removal market. Frontier's team facilitates purchases from high-potential carbon removal companies on behalf of buyers, with plans to open to new buyers in the future.
- Infrastructure AMC: Advance Market Commitments can also be applied to infrastructure projects, such as transportation, water supply, or telecommunications. By providing financial incentives and guaranteed markets, AMCs can encourage private-sector investment in critical infrastructure projects, particularly in regions where traditional financing models may be insufficient or unavailable.
