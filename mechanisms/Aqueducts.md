# Aqueducts

`Experimental`

### Description

Aqueducts are a mechanism to enhance the funding and sustainability of public goods projects, allowing the direct and continuous contribution of funds to projects. This ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and when aqueducts are community-governed, in accordance with community preferences. Aqueducts resemble community-governed faucets that channel protocol reserves or inflation to desired public goods funding pools. This concept can be extended to interconnect the revenue from various protocols such as Giveth, Gitcoin, and Optimism.

In the case of a protocol intended as a pure public good, 100% of its revenue may be directed to its aqueduct. Aqueducts are particularly valuable for new projects, as developers can assign a portion of their reserve or inflation to a Gitcoin Aqueduct. Gitcoin can then conduct a quadratic funding round, where projects that benefit the financing protocol are proposed, and community members allocate funds from the aqueduct to these projects. This process requires no intervention from project developers, allowing Gitcoin’s Aqueduct to separate the design and implementation of a protocol from its scaling and community management, thereby reducing the barriers to launching a protocol. 

An example of aqueduct implementation can be seen with Tally Ho, the first protocol to automate public goods funding using Gitcoin’s Aqueduct. Tally Ho committed 2.5% of its treasury to be divided between the Gitcoin Grants main pool and grant rounds to build the Tally Ho ecosystem. Acqueucts offer flexibility, as they can be integrated into protocols both at inception and in later stages. By using aqueducts, protocols can ensure continuous and sustainable funding & development of public goods projects.
