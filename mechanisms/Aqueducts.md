# Aqueducts

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Right, totally. Alrighty, well, the next one on our list is aqueduct, which is a mechanism that we've been talking about gitcoin speech, speaking of things that have been tried in the past, you know, in irrigation systems, aqueducts are a way of carrying water from one system to another. And so basically, you know, if you're building a pluralistic, civilizational scale system for funding public goods, and say there's, like giveth and CLR phone and gitcoin and optimism and all these other mechanisms, what does it look like to build bridges between those mechanisms as a mechanism itself? So you know, I there's something on the gitcoin governance forum about Aqua ducks. And basically the idea here is that if you sign up for a gitcoin, Aqua ducks, what you can do is as part of your initial token allocation, or as part of your ongoing efforts to build your your ecosystem, you can set an aqueduct from your main Treasury into gitcoin grants into a pool of funds that will be allocated to do quadratic funding for your own community. And then you can have a further aqueduct from that to the main matching pool to Ethereum public goods because you're built on top of Aetherium public goods and maybe you could even like if bitcoin gets there one day if there is a all open source or like all global public goods like climate and roads and bridges and all other global public goods, they're gonna be a further aqueduct from there. So awkward ducks are like, in ancient times a way of carrying water irrigation from one place to another. What if we could set up aqueducts that between the modules of public goods funding, and the example that I gave was, was the gitcoin matching pools, but you could imagine any sort of aqueduct that that goes between any of these mechanisms as we're building this pluralistic web scale, civilizational scale, infrastructure for funding public goods. And I think radical drips is doing a really interesting point here where like, it's, it's literally called Radical jumps. And you can program like faucets where a certain percentage will go here, and a certain percentage will go there, according to your governance. So I think it's a really interesting primitive to to think about, because everything that we're building in this space is so plural and modular.

Yeah, it's it's totally like a stream is the way you're saying it, right. Like that. Your your governance, your issuance of your token in some way, or you're some kind of allocation of funds, then, one way or another is streamed on a regular basis. Yeah. Like, do you have a, do you have a mechanism for that? Like, do you have like, a specific algorithm of how it gets distributed? Or like, how does the actual allocation get decided? I guess,

yeah, well, um, so I can only speak. So this is a generalizable thing that anyone can use to partner with any one else in this whole dowel of dollars that is being built but specific to get coin, there's an aqueduct that's going to be launching when get coin grants to launches. And I only know this because it was pre negotiated before I left get coins leadership. But basically, the idea is that there's a dowel launching. And I won't say who because it's not the right time to announce that but they're gonna have a lot of their initial allocation set to get coin aqueducts, at the initial conditions and governance can change it if they want. But basically, the tokens will flow over a vesting schedule into the get coin grants matching pool, get coin grants will run a quadratic funding round for that community. And there's and and a certain percentage of that community's tokens will go down into the main Aetherium matching pool. So they get to be sponsors of both matching pools. And it's just totally up to their governance, whether they want it like say get coin does a really great job, they could turn up the aqueduct or say get coin fucks it up, they could turn off the aqueduct and you know, use any other platform to do it. So basically, aqueducts are a way of going from, you know, it actually reminds me of is like, when I when I worked at a retirement company, it was like the most tried five job that I ever worked at before I got into crypto. And they were always trying to get people to put their a percentage of their paychecks into into their retirement funds. Because you set it and forget it. You don't have to remember to invest in retirement. It just happens as you're getting paid and aqueducts just kind of the same thing for community building or public goods funding.

Interesting, interesting. And is that would that be the first aqueduct that gitcoin Put out with this with this new doll?

There are things there Aqua Ducky, which is the word I just made up that have happened so far. But this will be the first formal like handshake remarketing and as an aqueduct thing, like gecko is doing.

Yeah, I mean, obviously, like you said, Rachael drips, I mean, I have a radical Jeff going right now. And it streams, you know, from the pot that I gave it to, to a few projects. And it's super cool, because then they can continue to stream on. And so maybe this idea of just like setting streams, set it and forget it, actually. And in general magic, which is an organization that run there's one person who's paid by a stream, right? Where they we don't pay them every month, they actually just have a stream set to them. And if they got fired, or, you know, we would end the stream. And if they got a raise, we would up the stream. Yeah. And that's, that's kind of it was a it's a beta test. But it's, it feels like the same kind of idea. And I think that's pretty cool.

Yeah, I mean, maybe I shouldn't have led with calling this aqueducts maybe now that you are calling it streaming money, because it's just really cool to have your paycheck paid every second or monthly subscription debited every single second. And it's almost like it reminds me of subscriptions are such a big mechanism in web two. But if you take the you know, I paid 999 a month for Netflix. And if you take a subscription down from monthly to weekly to daily to hourly to minutely to Secondly, you basically got streaming money at that point. So yeah, maybe maybe streaming money is the general high level primitive here. And it can be, you know, credibility and legitimacy. And tokens can be streamed from any of these mechanisms to any of these other mechanisms.
