### Description

Closed-ballot voting is a method of voting in which the ballots are sealed and kept private. This means that voters can cast their ballots without fear of reprisal or coercion, and the secrecy of the ballot allows voters to express their true preferences without being influenced by others. Closed-ballot voting is also known as secret voting or secret ballot.

The history of voting in democracies can be traced back to ancient Greece, where citizens would cast their votes by inscribing them on tablets that were placed in urns. The secrecy of the ballot was not a concern at this time because voting was limited to a small group of male citizens. Over time, voting became more inclusive and the secrecy of the ballot became an important aspect of democratic elections.
