# Retroactive Public Goods Funding

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Yeah. Well, Karl Floersch was like my second podcast guest on the Greenpilled podcast. And he's an inspiration for all of us. I wish he was here to explain it. Because of Optimism. They're actually implementing retroactive public goods funding. It's basically a way of doing public goods, funding. Public goods are just kind of like Commons goods, you can think of them retro actively. So basically, what they're doing at Optimism, and I'm going to do my best to describe it. Karl and Vitalik, if you're listening, then hopefully got it right. 

But basically, what they're doing is they're creating a committee of experts. And they're channeling about a million dollars worth of revenue from the Optimism network. And they're basically asking the committee of experts, which things in the past have delivered value to this ecosystem. So basically, if you're ethers js, if if you're building a client, a protocol level client and the Aetherium ecosystem, and you have not been rewarded for your work in the public goods, then retroactive public goods funding means that you can have some sort of assurance that if you create good for public goods, then that committee of expert at n years into the future is going to recognize that and is going to reward you in the future. Why does that matter, you can create an incentive in the present, to work on public goods to work on the commons. If you have a reasonable, rational, rational, rational, legitimate belief that in the future, you will be rewarded for that. So you can affect the behavior in the present, based off of this idea that there will be millions, if not billions of dollars of public goods in the future. And what becomes really cool about this is that you can allocate if you're a VC and and you want to fund things that are going to generate a return for your investors, right? You have a fiduciary duty to invest in things that are going to produce a return for your investors. You can start looking Get public goods now. And you can say, well, I can assume that Optimism is going to have an millions of dollars worth of funding for retroactive public goods, and M years in the future. And this project is doing a lot of verified public good. And I might get an exit out of investing into this public good thing in the present. And so you can get more capital and talent to rotate towards more regen projects in the present because you've got this future expectation of retroactive public goods. So there's a reflexivity between the present behavior in the amount of public goods that are created and the future legitimacy of the belief that public goods are going to be funded retroactively.

Yeah, that was a lot. Okay. It is. But and that's, that's probably the biggest challenge is retroactive public goods, at least that like, I think that retroactive public goods on the base layer is a perfect mechanism in a way because it cannot fail, it will fund some public goods, you know,

well, the other thing is like, it's easier to see, say what has provided value in the past then speculate on what is going to provide value in the future. So the retroactive thing makes things way harder on one dimension, but also way easier on another dimension.

And it makes it easier on the hardest dimension, which is distribution, you know, all of these all of these goals, most of the most of these mechanisms is like how do we distribute funds to the right people, and retroactive public goods funding just kind of says, Don't worry about it. Let's just see who succeeds. Right. And and that's huge. Now bootstrapping the market that it might potentially derive. That's going to be a lot of work. That's the biggest challenge is that is achieving the full on dream. But there's no fail. Like if you have a donation pot retroactive public goods funding is such a great strategy.
