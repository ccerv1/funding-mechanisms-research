# Holographic Consensus

`Experimental`

### Description

Holographic Consensus is a type of consensus algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed group of nodes. It is designed to be more efficient than traditional consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).

Holographic Consensus is based on the concept of "holographic signatures". A holographic signature is a digital signature that is generated by combining multiple digital signatures from different parts of a digital image. In the context of consensus, a holographic signature is generated by combining the digital signatures of all the nodes in a network.

The advantage of using holographic signatures is that they can be verified much more quickly than traditional digital signatures. This is because a holographic signature contains all the information that is needed to verify the signature, whereas a traditional digital signature only contains a small amount of information.

Another advantage of holographic signatures is that they are very difficult to forge. This is because, in order to forge a holographic signature, an attacker would need to have access to all the nodes in a network and be able to generate digital signatures from all of them.

Holographic Consensus is still in the early stages of development and has not been widely adopted yet. However, it has the potential to be a more efficient and secure alternative to traditional consensus algorithms.

### Examples

- [Corda](https://www.corda.net/) is a distributed ledger platform that uses Holographic Consensus.
- [Holo](https://holochain.org/) is a distributed ledger platform that is based on Holographic Consensus.
