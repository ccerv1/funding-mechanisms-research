# Prop.house

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

let me just say we prop houses and we can compare and contrast them. So it's not good. Yeah. Cool. So prop house is the noun style funding mechanism and nouns has a treasury of several 10s of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions of dollars. 29,000 ETH. Okay, God. And so they use prop house. How it works is communities hold funding rounds in their community houses in these funding rounds, builders can propose ideas to get funding, the flow is as follows a funding round is put up by a community. Each funding round has a fixed amount of capital to be one. And it's composed by a proposing and a voting period. During the proposing period, builders can propose ideas they'd like to get funding, the proposing period ends after the voting period starts community token holders vote on their favorite proposals. And then the top proposals get funding so that it feels like some sort of inversion to me, but I know how do those differ from, from your perspective,

the big differences, it's still within one dial, right? Even though there's committees and stuff and there's still only one funder. That's that's the biggest that's the biggest thing. But I think it stands on its own is a very successful mechanism. ENS uses it to they call it an A small grants. And and I think the cool thing about Prop house is the user experience of proposing a grant is just so much easier. You know, these these school baits, yeah, yeah. But let's, let's finish this thing off. With a bash so
