### Description

Grand Challenges are a type of research and development (R&D) funding program that aims to address specific, large-scale problems or opportunities that require innovative solutions. These programs are often sponsored by governments, philanthropic organizations, or other entities with a vested interest in seeing these challenges solved. Grand Challenges typically offer substantial prize money as an incentive for entities to develop and implement solutions.
