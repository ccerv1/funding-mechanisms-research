# Check-off Programs

`Legacy`

### Description

Check-off programs are a type of industry self-help mechanism, where a small fee or "check-off" is levied on the sale of agricultural and other commodities. These fees are collected and used to fund research, marketing, and promotional activities for those commodities. Check-off programs are typically overseen by government agencies but are funded and operated by the industries themselves, not tax dollars. 

Check-off fees are usually paid by producers, marketers, or processors of the commodities, and the fees collected are then used to fund programs that benefit the entire industry. These may include research into new uses for the commodity, marketing campaigns to promote the commodity, and educational programs to inform consumers about the commodity.

Check-off programs are a form of self-imposed taxation, with producers and industry members voluntarily contributing funds for the betterment of their entire industry. These programs have been successful in promoting various commodities and in helping to advance industry-wide goals.

### Examples

- The Beef Check-off Program: A $1-per-head fee is collected on the sale of live domestic and imported cattle, in addition to a comparable assessment on imported beef and beef products. The funds are used to promote beef and beef products domestically and internationally.
- The Soybean Check-off Program: U.S. soybean farmers contribute a portion of their sales, specifically 0.5% of the market price per bushel sold, towards research and marketing efforts to promote soybeans and soybean products.
