# Crowdfunding

`New`

### Description

Crowdfunding for charity involves using an online platform to raise funds for a specific cause or nonprofit organization. Donors can contribute money to the campaign, which is typically organized and promoted by the nonprofit or a group of volunteers. 

Some of the leading crowdfunding platforms currently include: Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Gofundme, and Mightycause.

Successful crowdfunding for charity efforts often have a clear and compelling message, a well-defined goal, and a strong social media presence to promote the campaign and engage potential donors.


### Examples

- The Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised millions of dollars for the ALS Association in 2014 through a viral social media campaign in which people nominated their friends to either donate to the cause or pour a bucket of ice water over their heads.
- GoFundMe's "Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund," which raised over $20 million in 2017 to support victims of the Hurricane Harvey disaster in Texas.
