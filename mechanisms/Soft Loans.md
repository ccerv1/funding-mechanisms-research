# Soft Loans

`Legacy`

### Description

A soft loan, also known as concessional lending, is a loan with terms significantly more generous than market loans. These terms can include lower interest rates, extended grace periods where only interest or service charges are due, and longer time periods for the repayment of principal. Soft loans are often made by governments and institutions as a form of economic aid to developing countries or regions, enabling projects and initiatives that otherwise may not be economically viable.

### Examples

- World Bank Soft Loans: The World Bank often provides soft loans to developing countries to support infrastructure development and poverty reduction efforts. These loans usually come with very low interest rates and have long repayment periods, enabling countries to invest in projects that can stimulate economic growth and improve quality of life.
- Asian Development Bank (ADB) Soft Loans: The Asian Development Bank offers soft loans to its member countries, particularly focusing on the poorest and most vulnerable communities. These loans may support a variety of projects, such as renewable energy development, agricultural modernization, or access to clean water and sanitation facilities.
