# Futurarchy

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Man, I don't know future archy that Well, honestly. But it's basically voting on on kind of like impact market, Effective Altruism, where you're making a bet that this that the future will end up a certain way, and that this proposal will actually have a huge impact. And you get rewarded if they do. So it's kind of like, including the impact of the of the proposal on the economy or on whatever you're voting in with, with your choice to vote yes or no on it. So if you support it, you would get rewarded if it had a huge impact. But you wouldn't if it didn't. So it's kind of like bringing in voters into the the prediction market.

Well, we could do a whole nother episode on my prediction markets are powerful, but it seems like basically, you basically kind of like bet on an outcome that you want to see. And that creates a reflexive incentive to make sure that that outcome, X actually happens. So like creates the coordination incentive. Am I getting that right at all?

I think so. But honestly, it's been I haven't looked at future archy since 2018 2019, when people were developing on it, but prediction markets in web three never really took off.

So So according to Wikipedia, which is our primary source of this podcast is for future archy. The rest of them we know for sure. It is a form of government government proposed by economists. Robin Hanson. I like Robin Hanson, in which elected officials define measures of national well being and prediction markets are used to determine which policies will have the most positive effects. So basically, if you bet on the right horse, if you bet on the right policy, and that is the one that turns out, like you're basically using markets to sort through which policies are going to create the metric of national Well, being feels like this is powerful, because it leverages the power of markets. But also if like, what's the whole thing about like, once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure that feels like a little bit applicable here.

Yeah, totally. These metrics are so tough, you know, increasing GDP, works really well. If you have a war, you know, you destroy all the buildings, then there's a lot of things to build, right?

Well, it's also like, how do you measure national happiness? You know, like you said, it's hard to quantify happiness. So, you know, if you're gonna do it on things that we actually want to measure, then those things often aren't quantifiable.
