# Demurrage

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

So Demurrage, Demurrage the next one. And it's kind of like inflation is except the opposite. So you think of inflation, where you can even say like Bitcoin uses inflation to fund its public good, which is, you know, a secure blockchain for value transfer, anywhere, anyone in the world can create an address anywhere else in the world and receive money, which itself international access to an international financial system is a public good. So then they use inflation to do it. But demurrage is saying, actually, this money is becoming less valuable over time. And so if you if you thought if bitcoin were to be funded by inflation, what actually do is say oh, hey, Bitcoin holder, you're a fraction of your your Bitcoin that you have one Bitcoin? Well, in six months, it's going to be point nine, nine Bitcoin. And other point one bitcoin went to a common pool of funds. So it kind of it's supposed to inspire the velocity of money. And it's really, I mean, it was used way back in the day to really model after scarce resources that degraded like rice, or flour. And so like, the church would create a church would create a stamp that would would say, well, guess what, this rice is rotting. So this is this is valuable, this is worth one bag of rice, but you know, the bag gets smaller as time goes on, because the rice that's sitting there backing, it is degrading. And so that's what the Demurrage is modeled after. And but honestly, what I've seen is that these systems, this Demurrage has bad UX. I don't think it's a working good working system. I've never seen someone use Demurrage successfully. There are lots of people who have tried, but I think that there's in this human nature that we don't want things taken from us. You know, so like having one bitcoin turned to point nine nine is like, yeah, what the hell?

Well, let me ask you this. How is this different from taxes? I guess it's kind of like a wealth tax. It's not based off of your income. It's based off of your holdings.

Yes, exactly. So it's so it's very similar to Well, yeah, it's not an income, it's based off folded. So it's like, Hey, you're, you're you have $10 million. Well, you know, now you have less why. But But the funny thing is, inflation is the exact same mechanism.

Yeah, it's just your unit of account is debased.

Exactly. It has inflation has the exact same pattern, the exact same result, but the you user experience doesn't feel bad. Yeah.

Uh, yeah, it feels like I got more rich because I'm getting high. Yeah. All right. I'm going to channel my inner Erik Voorhees, a Remainer libertarian and say taxation is theft in Demurrage is probably theft. And so we should move on.
