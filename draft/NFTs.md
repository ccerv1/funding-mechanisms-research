# NFTs

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

I think we would be remiss not to add NF Ts, we actually talked before this call, you know, I'd like to try to scramble all these. And this one didn't really come up. But it's like, in the last couple years, it is a huge funding stream for public goods. And like public nouns, and rainbow rolls, and so many NFT projects for charities or for arts, that are really creating a public good, like, especially NFT art is so cool, because the art is accessible to anyone. Yes, they're theirs. And then they kind of create a digital scarcity around that piece of art. And the fact that it's a scarce resource, all of a sudden Creek allows it to create value. So the artists can fund their public good creation, which is Hey, art that anyone can see online, you can go to open sea, and it's like the, you know, the the right click Save is like stealing an NFT. Right. But they're actually proving the point, which is that especially NFT art, or whether it's music, or art, or any kind of art, it's, it's created this accessibility, which makes public good, while also creating a very unique funding stream. And, like, there's this really cool project called public nouns, which is using the nouns strategy of auctioning off one NFT, at a regular cadence in public nouns is it's every 12 hours to raise funds just to donate to projects, you know, and right now, they just use classical voting, but they could easily take the take these streams and donate it to quadratic funding to to the matching pool on get coin or to other various mechanisms. So I think NF T's are like the probably the biggest mainstream funding stream for digital public goods that we've seen come out of the web era mechanisms.

Yeah, I think that you know, this thing about NF T's makes me want to talk about a concept called Network goods. And basically what it is, is like private goods are rivalrous. Like if I if I have this iPhone, you can't have that iPhone. And public goods are things that are non rival risks, like I can breathe clean air, and you can breathe clean air, but there's a category of goods called Network goods get that get more valuable, the more people consume them. And like open source software is an example of this. The more people download this NPM package and submit their bug reports back and kick the tires on it, the more valuable it becomes for every other person who downloads that open source project. And this is what I think the value accrual mechanism between NF T with NF T's are is that the more attention is accrued to a piece of art, whether it's music, or an image or a movie that is NF T eyes, the more value is attributed to that is the same reason like information wants to be free in a networked information age environment. And the and, and so network by recognizing this property of network goods that are anti rival risks that grow more valuable, the more people consume, that we create a whole new category of business models for things and so I can own the NFT and the rights to it, but I can still let everyone else enjoy it. And in fact, the fact that everyone else is enjoying it makes it much more valuable to own. And so it kind of inverts this traditional scarcity based model of, of of selling art and music. And I think that that's kind of a really beautiful fundamental inversion of of how we're funding the arts. And I would say that art is a public good, depending on who it hits and, and and who it serves.

Absolutely. They were given at DEF CON, there's a project that was given away jackets that say street art is a public good, you know, and it really is an art isn't always a public good because sometimes you can buy it and keep in your house like a lot of really famous art. But NF T's are a public good, you know, and that's, that's really cool. And what NF T's really do, and we'll go into this more and like and maybe all network goods in some way. Create they that's this market of supply and demand, you're integrating market dynamics of supply and demand into a into a public goods funding stream, which is is amazing. And I really like this network goods analogy, and I would say that almost every crypto currency is effectively follows under that category.
