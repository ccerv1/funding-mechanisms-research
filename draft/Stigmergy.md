# Stigmergy

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Stigmergy? Yeah, Stigmergy, is basically the it's a mechanism of indirect coordination through which through the environment between agents or actions. So basically, the principle is that a trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agents. This is by the way, how ants coordinate, they don't have Wi Fi between each other be cool if it did, but like, they basically have to leave these pheromones, in which tell the other ants go over here, there's food here, or the nest is back this way. So they're leaving the Stigmergy trails, the more ants to go down these trails and the ones that really put down the more pheromones will lead more ants to go down in a certain direction. So maybe this isn't like a collective public goods funding allocation mechanism. him, but I think it's an attribute of other mechanisms is that like this is actually by the way, maybe quadratic funding is the way to connect. This is like, if you find this grant, then that's a stick merge it. That's the equivalent of like an ant pheromone that says go here, like if I trust Griff, and he says, lays down a pheromone on the on this gitcoin Grant, then that I'm gonna fund it. So maybe this is more of a property of the other mechanisms, then mechanism in itself,

get the cart functionality that you had when you could share a cart very Stigmergy?

Yeah, yeah. Um, so what I think is interesting is like the reflexivity of some of these things, we're one agent doing an action causes other agents to follow down that action. And if you can create a web of trust that says, Hey, these are the people that have high credibility, and they get more credibility, the more good stuff they do, and they lose credibility, the worse stuff they do, like there's kind of a reflexive Stigmergy attribute to a lot of these mechanisms, which is cool. Yeah. All right.
