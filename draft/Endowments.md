`Legacy`

### Description

An endowment is a financial asset, often in the form of a fund or pool of money, that is donated to a nonprofit organization, educational institution, or other entity for the purpose of providing ongoing support and financial stability. The funds in an endowment are typically invested, and the organization or institution uses the income generated from these investments to support its operations, programs, and initiatives.

### Examples

- The Harvard University Endowment: This is a financial fund managed by the Harvard Corporation, the governing body of Harvard University. The endowment is used to support the university's academic programs, research initiatives, and other activities.
- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Endowment: This is a financial fund managed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropic organization that supports initiatives in global health, education, and other areas. The endowment is used to fund the foundation's charitable work around the world.
