# Proof of Work

`New`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Yeah, proof of work is obviously this the predecessor to proof of stake and staking, which, which is how Bitcoin decides its, its distribution. And, you know, people think, proof of work, you know, how is this a collective resource allocation, but actually, you know, they are choosing the fork choice rule, they're choosing over this public good that like, which, which blocks are actually the ones that are the truth, and, and the shared history. But beyond that, actually, proof of work is used in a lot of other cool projects, to distribute resources. So there's the resource, of course, is inflation is the issuance. I like this separation of issuance versus inflation. And inflation is like the experience of issue is issuance affecting the market, but issuance is just like, hey, we're worse, we're throwing we're printing money, you know, and that actually doesn't always cause inflation, if there's other dynamics involved. So the the proof of work distributes issuance, and if but sometimes the work is awesome, right, like Cure coin or folding coin. And actually, the proof the work that's being done is actually folding proteins for cancer research and, and Alzheimer's research. And, and then the people who fold more proteins actually get more issuance, I think, proof of work, you know, starting in the digital space is super cool, because it's very easy to be held accountable to the work that you're doing. But in many ways, we're actually taking proof of work to the next level in the public good space. And we're trying to say, hey, let's, let's use some of these other collective resource allocation to create proof of work issuance in a way right where when, when working workstream and get coin actually gets funding. Where did that money come from? Right? It came from the DAO what and that that was tokens were not in the circulating supply for so you could almost say that's a proof of work, right. Issuance has been allocated, using, you know, our public goods Lagos or or piecing all these things together to actually make issuance affects more than just the digital space.

Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, there's a lot of power in proof of work. And it's useful to remember that when proof of work has been mostly associated with Bitcoin experiments, like Folding at Home and other, I think SETI at home was the, as an astronomy nerd when I was growing up one of the original OG mechanisms of of doing work for a distributed network. So I'm not a big fan of the carbon output on the Bitcoin network. But the fact that there are proof of work networks that are way more carbon neutral than Bitcoin makes me not want to throw out the whole the whole category.

Yeah, there's actually a coin I don't know if it's even still around, I think it was called Grid coin or something that you could plug in any at home system, and earn grid coin. So you could do Folding at Home, you could do study at home, you could do that at home spectrum is why I think there's a lot of these cool, and and I just love it because you're taking something that was altruistic, and actually just flipping a switch and say no, actually, it's economic. And now, boom, people are actually doing it more like folding folding coin and Curecoin have been number one on the Folding at Home like workboard ever since they started, just because they're printing magic internet money for the people who are participating. And that's just more effective than altruism.
