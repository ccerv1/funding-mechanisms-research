# Joke Race

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

So I hate to do this to you, but I'm gonna rug you and add one more mechanism to the event or to the list. And that's based off of the insight that you have that the best mechanisms here are going to feel fun. So I'm adding Joke race to the list, which is basically a bottoms up on chain governance for communities to sit entries and vote on their favorites. And it's actually I think that joke Dao made a mechanism where people pitch jokes to the joke dowel and they get funding if they tell and but you could use it for anything you could use it for curating a community roadmap community endorsements bounties, generating ideas curations and giveaways. But they've implemented it in the funniest stickiest way possible at joke Dao by just making it a distributed decentralized joke contest every week, so you got to get a joke out to to find out and I don't know, I'm just browsing the website and reading what I see. It's got a token called joke, the joke token. And there's a joke race every looks like every every week. I'm getting that right.
