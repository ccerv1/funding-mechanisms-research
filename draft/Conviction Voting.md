# Conviction Voting (+ Osmotic Funding)

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

That's why I kind of brought up that initial thing with current funding because conviction voting mitigates plutocracy in a similar way as quadratic funding. Except it does it with time, instead of one person, one vote. It's like if you have more tokens, you have more say, but even if you just have a minority share, you can still pass a large proposal. With with it just takes more time for it to pass. So it's it's just like voting where there'll be a bunch of proposals. But instead of having like a two week time limit, where you say yes or no, all the proposals are competing against each other. And you allocate your tokens to the ones that you like the most. And there's kind of a conviction voting comes from the big brains behind blocks science, like Michael Zargon, was implemented at one hive, mostly by Sam and Gabby. And we'll J. Griff. And those guys put put it all together so that when your it works really well, if there's a lot of proposals competing against each other and a clear budget of how much you want to allocate in a given time, then conviction voting is a great solution. And actually, it's also been augmented, so that it can be more of a streaming approach. So the more tokens that are behind instead of the proposal passing, I can conviction voting, the tokens kind of sit behind a proposal, and you can take them on or off at anytime, but then it gains conviction. The longer the token sit there, and eventually once it meets the threshold, which is based on how much money it's asking for. All that money goes to the person asking for the money with automatic funding, which is this new augmentation of it. Instead, it's like there's a constant stream to all of the proposals that are requesting funds that have tokens behind them. And you can kind of measure, you can kind of change the rate that's going of funding to the different proposals. So it's kind of like radical drips, but with a token behind it, where you're voting on how to allocate the funds, the collective funds.

So I mean, it seems like the powerful thing here is that I can take my tokens which represent my share of some DAO or some resource, and I can put them into a bucket. And over time conviction is developed by the number of tokens times the amount of time that it's been in that bucket. And that gives some signal to the system that this is a good proposal. And so the more the more money in the more time that it has been in that system than the more we can have conviction that that people actually care about that thing. And I think that is what's really cool is that I think we looked at when it back when I was a Gitcoin DAO, we looked at conviction voting as a way of doing budget proposals where instead of having this quarterly budget, where it's like yes or no, you either get this amount of tokens, or you don't, we could just take conviction on the causes that we care about. And then, you know, say instead of getting 100,000 tokens for this big quarterly budget process, I could just take a certain amount of tokens. And if like, say I need to, like pay for pizza, or like laptops or something like that, then for smaller amounts of funding, it's such a lower risk way of creating a decentralized market for which causes are good. And it's like a state conviction on those things. And there'll be a bucket of money that no one has to go through this big budget process to get in, they could get it through conviction voting. So that's a plus of conviction voting that I'm aware of, you know, what do you think the pluses and minuses are here?

I think conviction voting works really well. As long as there's a lot of proposals, when there's not a lot of proposals happening. It's too easy sometimes to pass a proposal because you're basically mandating the DAO to spend money at a certain rate effect effectively. And so it's really easy to pass proposals if there's not a lot of competition. So I think it works really well for big, big things. And, and like the biggest plus is exactly that, that minority opinions can actually pass proposals, like I think, like, like, even if there's a small group of people that have a lot of conviction behind this idea, but the majority doesn't like it. Now in an in a normal Dallas situation, that just could never happen. Like they couldn't pass it. But in conviction voting, they could, as long as they had enough of enough conviction, they were patient enough to hold their tokens behind that concept. And then it would pass in. So I think it's the coolest thing, the biggest plus is that minority opinions can actually pass a pass for forces.
