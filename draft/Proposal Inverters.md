# Proposal Inverters

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Yeah, the proposal is very, super cool. It's basically like, imagine a gitcoin grant with a with a, you know, a cap, I guess it has a funding goal. And and then if anyone can fund it, which is nice, because most proposals, you have to create a proposal to one Dow, right. And you hope it gets funded? And it's kind of a binary yes or no. But with this, you can make one proposal and lots of dollars or individuals can fund it. And then then it's released to the so to the party who made the proposal. So you can imagine a market for proposals and and then it also has a lot of cool features, like milestones. So maybe all the funders agreed to these milestones, and they fund it and and once, once it reaches $10,000, then the first $2,000 will go to the project, they have to complete some milestone, there's an assigned reviewer. And if they achieve that milestone, then they get the next $5,000. Right, and then if they achieve the whole thing, they get the last 3000. And so but what's the coolest thing is the inversion, right? The fact that lots of people can fund this, and it's not a proposal for one now but you know, if you're solving a problem that helps a lot of different Dallas, they could all fund it together.
