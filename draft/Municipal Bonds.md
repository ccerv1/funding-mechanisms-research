# Municipal Bonds

`Legacy`

### Description

A municipal bond, also known as a muni bond, is a type of debt security issued by a state, city, or local government to raise funds for public projects and services. Municipal bonds are typically backed by the creditworthiness and taxing power of the issuing government entity, which makes them a relatively safe investment for investors. Municipal bonds are typically issued in a variety of maturities, ranging from a few years to several decades, and they can offer a fixed or variable interest rate.

### Examples

- New York City Municipal Bonds: The city of New York issues municipal bonds to finance a wide range of public projects and infrastructure improvements, such as transportation, schools, and parks. These bonds are typically rated as investment grade by credit rating agencies and are widely held by investors.
- California Municipal Bonds: The state of California issues municipal bonds to fund various public projects and initiatives, such as schools, highways, and environmental initiatives. California municipal bonds are known for their diverse range of issuers and projects, and are often considered to be a good investment option due to the state's strong economy and growing population.
