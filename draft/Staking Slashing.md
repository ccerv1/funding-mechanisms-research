# Staking and Slashing

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Yeah, so another one that we were like, Oh, wait, we didn't cover this we should have is staking and slashing. So basically eath just moved to proof of stake and the mechanism there is that you put 32 eath. Up at stake. And basically you run a validator and as long as that validator follows the protocol consensus route rules, then it will get a slight inflationary piece of the of the supply. Well, inflationary in some sense, but the actual total network is deflationary for reasons that are external to this mechanism. But basically, it can be the your stake can be slashed, if you are, if you if you lie, so to the protocol. So basically, if you can, if you do anything that could cause a consensus fork, then then basically you can be slashed, and you lose your deposit. And there's also an inactivity leak where if you're offline for like a day or two, you lose a couple of of Gwei a day. And so basically, it's a way of creating a crypto economic incentive to because money is at stake and can be slashed or increased at anytime by the protocol. It's a way of aligning capital with a certain set of outcomes. And I think that the validators are a really kind of neat way of doing sticking of slashing, but there's lots of application examples of staking and slashing that are out there. I think that actually get coin and giveth have been experimenting with some form of staking at least evict with gitcoin. I know that you could stake on certain grants for a little while that you thought were high quality. And the algorithm would take that into account in one of its sorting mechanisms on the UI and the sorting mechanism and forms what gets funded. So you know, by staking your GTC, you're actually able to push up and down the grants in the system. But y'all have y'all giveth have some staking. implemented, right.

Yeah, it's GIV power. And so we're like a week from launching maybe two weeks from launching just some UX issues. And then and then it's live. But right now you can stake and lock in, you end up getting this give power. And so the longer you lock, the more get power you get. And also the higher your APR, your your staking rewards, you could say that you earn for for locking. And then with that give power, you curate the projects on the platform. So if you want to support your favorite nonprofit project without donating, you can actually just stake give tokens effectively behind that project. And then boom, they'll end up with what do we have our matching funds system, they'll get more matching rewards, they'll they'll be higher up on the list. So people see them faster when they want to donate. And also, what I mentioned before, and actually the last episode was the donor rewards the donation money that is actually determined based on how much give power is locked behind each project. So so it's, I think, like, it's basically this staking proving you have skin in the game, you know, that gives you the power to kind of man manage certain pieces of the project, I think one inch does it too. And with their with a few of their variables that you can change. There's there's a lot of projects that that where you stake and lock, some kind of asset of value. And that basically keeps you honest, I think it's it's a great mechanism. Yeah, I

think that, um, while we're talking about the pluses and minuses of each mechanism, I think it's really great if you have capital, but that's the biggest downside is that it requires capital. And therefore, in a sense, there's a certain amount of plutocratic, because if you're deploying to a population that isn't going to take their is living paycheck to paycheck or isn't going to otherwise isn't going to put their capital into a staking mechanism, then you've got the nothing at stake problem.

Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think this kind of monetary, like plutocracy isn't so bad when you're managing a shared pot of funds. Right? It's not, it's not ideal. I don't think quadratic plutocracy is better. But in the end, if you're dealing with financial input, then having the people that are putting in financial, you know, the financial power, it's important to have it in there. But if you're trying to, you know, figure out the laws of a country, or, you know, the most decisions are not financial in nature, so these kinds of mechanisms just wouldn't be a good idea.
