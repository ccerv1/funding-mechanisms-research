### Description

> Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.
-- Oliver Wendell Holmes

Taxes are mandatory contributions levied on individuals or organizations by a government entityâ€”whether local, regional, or national. Tax revenues finance government activities, including public works and services such as roads and schools.

There are several common types of taxes, including income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, and taxes on goods and services. Income taxes are taxes that are levied on the income earned by individuals and businesses. Property taxes are taxes that are levied on real estate or personal property. Sales taxes are taxes that are levied on the sale of goods and services. 

Taxes on goods and services, also known as consumption taxes, are taxes that are levied on the consumption of certain goods and services. There are several different forms of consumption taxes, including value-added taxes (VAT) and excise taxes. VAT is a type of consumption tax that is applied to the value added at each stage of the production and distribution of goods and services. Excise taxes are taxes that are levied on the production or sale of specific goods or services, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.

There also exist different general forms of tax policy:
- Progressive tax: A tax that takes a larger percentage of income from high-income groups than from low-income groups.
- Proportional tax: A tax that takes the same percentage of income from all income groups. Also known as a "flat" tax.
- Regressive tax: A tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups. 

In the United States there are progressive income taxes and regressive Social Security and property taxes. Excise taxes and user fees are somewhat regressive. This combination results in taxpayers paying roughly the same percentage of their incomes in taxes, creating a proportional system. Vertical equity is the concept that people in different income groups should pay different rates of taxes.
