# Tithes

`Legacy` 

### Description

Tithes are a form of charitable giving in which a portion of a person's income is donated to a religious organization, such as a church. In many religious traditions, tithes are typically collected by church leaders or designated representatives during regular worship services. In some cases, members of the congregation may be asked to bring their tithes to the front of the church and place them in a collection basket or plate. In other cases, tithes may be collected through automatic bank transfers or online giving platforms. The specific method of collection may vary depending on the individual church and its practices.

The word "tithe" comes from Old English word for "tenth", ie, a one-tenth part of something.

### Examples

- Plutarch (46-after 119 CE) wrote: "But the greatest and most apparent cause of their dislike against him arose from the tenths of the spoil; the multitude having here, if not a just, yet a plausible case against him.  For it seems, as he went to the siege of Veii, he had vowed to Apollo that if he took the city he would dedicate to him the tenth of the spoil." 
- Ireland: From the English Reformation in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain Roman Catholic and had to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland.
- Zakāt (Arabic: زكاة [zækæːh]) or "alms giving", one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is the giving of a small percentage of one's assets to charity. It serves principally as the welfare contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share.
