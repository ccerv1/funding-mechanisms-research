# Budget Box

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

budget box is a really cool concept that came some came from some giga brains from the colony ecosystem. And it was actually they wrote a really beautiful paper in 2018. And it's basically pairwise assessment. So think of like Tinder or hot or not, except instead of having to swipe right or left, it's really compared to you like this get coin project or this get constraint or that get coin grant, you know, and you just have to pick one or the other. And so I really like budget box, because it's a, it's effectively a really easy UX voting methodology. So you can, you can just say, you can start ranking projects, but it's really fun. It's a really good way to give qualitative assessments, which is naturally really hard and distributed in a fun way. Like, I like this one. I like that one. And it's really easy and low cognitive overhead, especially versus reading forum posts about like, which project is the best, you know?

Yeah. So it's a way of, instead of swiping right on a possible date, I'm swiping right on a given grant, or giveth grant that I want to do, I want, I want to like just take the listener into a home. And this is gonna be deeply technical, it's gonna sound deeply technical, but it's not hard. Let's go there. There's this technology called collaborative filtering, which basically allows a website to say, okay, user x likes a, b, and c, and d, and user y likes a and b, maybe they like C and D, also, at scale, at web scale. So it pairs you as a user with other users who are who have similar preferences to you, and uses the collective intelligence of oh, this user likes C and D, maybe this other user who is like them, also like C and D. And so once you have budget, but once you have a sufficient amount of data on the profile of the users, you actually don't have to make to have them make all these complicated decisions. But with the with the data set at scale, you can actually use collaborative filtering, in order to figure out what, what they may like with a higher frequency. And by the way, this is like, what powers on Facebook, your suggested friends and your Amazon related items on your shopping cart. Like this is a very web to era technology. And it's what would I think make budget box really powerful?

Yeah, I mean, I think just as an overall process, this is what we need to get into voting. We need to get these web to like machine learning algorithms into getting us to signal our preference with very low effort, right? Like, why no one I don't have to vote for what ads are shown to me on Amazon. It has aggregates the data and then like, picks one if, if if only voting was that easy, you know, if only I could just have my own personal server with an AI bot. Where I control the data. And I put in all of my texts, all my communications through this thing, and then all my voting that I have to do, because like I'm a steward for GTC. I'm a steward. And so the steward for optimism that I give a token engineer comments. Oh, my God, how do you do it all? 

You know, I'm exhausted just hearing that list.

Horrible. But but you know, I'm very excited about public goods, and then with three, so we got to do it. But wouldn't it be great if I could just train an AI bot send in all of my communications, and it would just like, kind of make a guess on what I would vote for. And I just have to like, watch it once in a while. You know, when voting USB that easy.

One of the things I like to do like, when we're back when we were doing user tests of get clink grants for like, people would load up a bunch of carts, and then they would check out in one transaction is like, after the confirmation page came up. I was like, gotcha, you don't know it. But you just voted like you thought you were funding something in an E commerce style UI. But actually, you were participating in democracy, like, gotcha. Because it like the best, I think that your like your thesis is absolutely right, is that future democracy will not feel like driving to the ballot box and ticking a bunch of boxes. And it'll feel a little bit more like it could be bundled up in an E commerce workflow or a workflow that feels a little bit more elegant. And I think that there's like going to be a whole category of mechanisms that don't feel like work. But Are you're actually doing work in creating collective intelligence for the for the collective.
