# Praise

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

Praise is so cool. I love praise, because it's a kind of a reward system slash reputation system, where it's very bottom up and peer to peer collaborative. So you might have like a collective pot where you say, Hey, we're gonna give away, you know, $2,000, to the people who are praised every two weeks. And praise is super simple. It's just the discord bot, or you say, I praise Kevin Waukee. For this, and for the incredible podcast, that he runs, green pill is an inspiration to the region movement, right? And, and then those praises just kind of build up. And you could just just use it as a way to inspire a culture of gratitude, don't have to do anything further from that, because I feel like in the digital space, that's missing a lot. But where it becomes a collective allocation mechanism is in the quantification aspect. So this is this is addressing this problem, how do we, how do we quantify qualitative value creation, and the best way is human signaling, you know, humans being the transformer. So at the end of a two week period, the quantifiers will step up, and they'll be rewarded for quantifying and they'll say, hey, they'll, they'll give a score to each praise. And then each qualitative input of praise of gratitude, right actually ends up with a token allocation, based off of these scores. And so you can kind of have this like, repeatable thing, but there's so many cool second order effects, the gratitude component, and just the high fives. And then of course, like, you end up with the quantifiers, getting kind of an overview of a lot of things that are happening in the community. And the coolest thing, though, is you get all this data, you get all this very rich data, that you could effectively use machine learning techniques to take that data and use it. So to inspire the community or inform the community about who's doing what, and this sort of thing. So it's gonna be super cool.

I feel like I feel compelled to mention coordinape here because I know that they're doing giving circles at scale, and token allocations based off of them. And so I just compelled to be feel compelled to mention them, because they're a prominent part of I mean, how would you compare and contrast to the way coordinate works with with praise?

Coordinape is really cool, because it's, it's the same kind of human signaling, qualitative, qualitative input, where people are disturbing things. But and it but it's and it's lower effort in many ways, because it just happens once a month, right? And people are distributing the data. And so but, but it's harder, in some ways, because there isn't this, this reason why, right? Like, with with praise, you get this reason why someone got some amount of tokens every time and, uh, with coordinate, it's, it's the, it's way easier and way lower effort, but then you don't have the reason why, you know, so So but but they're also great shows and I want to give a shout out to otter otter space, too. They're they're another up and coming reputation system, like reward system that's coming through with NFT's and leveling up and ft badges and they're doing cool stuff. So I think there's a lot of action in the rewards and reputation system game and think we need it. Yeah,

I mean, so there's this idea of the Web of Trust, which is basically like it was kind of invented. This is what PageRank at Google was where basically, Larry and Sergey realized that any websites linked to another website was an implicit vote of trust in that website. And when you aggregate a graph and distribute reputation according to those links, you can rank the web based off of the distributed collective intelligence of what the web thinks is valuable. And you create this iterative sort of evolutionary game where you deliver trust in a system. And I think it's really interesting, like I see this with praise and with otter space and with coordinates in which people vote on each other and who they think is valuable is adding value. And that creates a similar Web of Trust type model. And now we can drop tokens on top of the web of trust with makes it even cooler. And and so, um, I want to connect that to another video. But I'm curious if you have thoughts on web trust before I do.

I love I love the web trust model, I feel like there's like trust lines, and Bright ID and circles are all using that too. And I feel like there are a whole nother form of, of in some ways, what we're talking about or collected using collective intelligence to allocate resources that we totally missed.

You can you can create sybil resistance with that, too. And listeners know that I'm obsessed with sybil resistance. The idea that I wanted to connect here was this, I really feel like what we're doing in region, web three is connecting financial capital to other types of capital. In this scenario, we're not only connecting financial capital to social and cultural capital, but we're making the financial capital subservient to our social and cultural capital, as opposed to the social and cultural capital, being subservient to the financial capital. And so there's this there's this idea from Gregory Landau, the founder of regen network, that there's eight types of capital, social capital, material, financial, living intellectual, this podcast is a form of intellectual capital, spiritual capital and cultural capital, what would it mean to build a financial system that doesn't extract these other type of capitals in order to create financial upside, but instead is in service of the hard to quantify spiritual and living in material capital, that we were like, this is really about inverting the relationship of Finance to these other types of capital, in my opinion.

Absolutely. And I think this is where so many of these things that we're talking about are all about this, how do we take something qualitative and quantify it? Because if we, if we can get really good at that, then all those other financial capital, all those other structured forms of capital can actually be integrated into systems that we actually that we really want? Yeah, because financial capital is great, because it's so quantifiable, it's just like, look, I made some money, you know, it's in a spreadsheet, like coordination is easy. But if we can coordinate around qualitative value, now we have so much of a richer society.
