# Donation Mining

`Experimental`

### Description

*unedited transcript*

I'm thinking like give power veCurve veBal, and maybe one day veGTC is like this vote escrow? Right. So it's how do we distribute a streaming reward to something the veCurve veBal, these are really built to distribute rewards to liquidity providers that are willing to like either put their money in curve or in balancer, but give power we're using it to actually distribute rewards to donors. So anyone If you can stake in luck give tokens behind a project. And then the more give tokens that are locked behind that project, the more give backs go to the donors of the project. So give back says this mechanism. We didn't actually add it in here as a mechanism. But when people donate to projects on giveth, they get, they get the web three tax deduction, which is give tokens. And so like, like, for instance, the the the funding pool, the man the matching pool that gitcoin has is actually on giveth. So if you wanted to fund get coins matching pool, the best place to do is on giveth because if you send money on giveth, then you'll actually get give tokens in return subsidizing your donation. And we'd give power, that amount of gift tokens that are giving back to people is actually modulated by the amount of give token staked behind the project. And and unfortunate the problem with this is that it's very clear kradic plutocratic.

So if I say this back to you, it seems like if I give to the get coin grants matching pool, which by the way, there'll be a link in the show notes, if anyone wants to get there, give back. The basically, if I give n dollars, then I'll get em dollars worth of gift backs and gives tokens. And basically it's a way of rewarding people for funding things with by creating a sort of distribution of governance, of giveth. And so basically it's a it's a way of allocating the ownership slash governance of giveth. And at the same time incentivizing more people to use giveth, thus bootstrapping the network effects of giveth. Is that right?

Exactly. It's like donation mining, you know, instead of giving mining rewards to people who are you know, solving, like proof of work schemes. Here we're giving mining rewards to donors.

I love that. Donation mining is a meme that you should create a for for all the yield farmers that are around in defi. Summer donation mining I think is a really interesting idea.
